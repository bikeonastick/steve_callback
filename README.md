# Response to e-mail about jruby and reflection

[ In his e-mail to jruby-user ]( http://markmail.org/message/eom22fof25t4wyu4 ), [boberetezeke](https://gist.github.com/boberetezeke) was asking about differences between `jrubyc` and `jrubyc --java` followed by compiling.

I think I found his issue. I took his [gist from here](https://gist.github.com/boberetezeke/ba919d3e45fca0f18a2d) and added some scripting.
